    "\n",
    "It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around `Werkzeug` and `Jinja` and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 17.2\tUnderstanding ‘Micro’\n",
    "`“Micro”` does not mean that your whole web application has to fit into a single Python file (although it certainly can), nor does it mean that Flask is lacking in functionality. The “micro” in microframework means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask won’t make many decisions for you, such as what database to use. Those decisions that it does make, such as what templating engine to use, are easy to change. Everything else is up to you, so that Flask can be everything you need and nothing you don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Flask does not include a database abstraction layer, form validation or anything else where different libraries already exist that can handle that. Instead, Flask supports extensions to add such functionality to your application as if it was implemented in Flask itself. Numerous extensions provide database integration, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and more. Flask may be “micro”, but it’s ready for production use on a variety of needs.\n"

    "**Werkzeug:** Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 17.5 HTTP Methods:\n",
    "- Flask like any other web application development framework, utilizes the HTTP methods. Let’s see the most used methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) GET:** The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **For example,** we can have an API called getCustomerDetails which returns the details of customers based on customerID. \n",
    "\n",
    "**b) POST:** The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the  entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "      - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,\n",
    "        or similar group of articles;\n",
    "      - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a\n",
    "        form, to a data-handling process;\n",
    "      - Extending a database through an append operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **For example,** we can have an addCustomer API which can add the new customers to the customer database.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**c) PUT:** The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **For Example,** we can use an updateCustomer API which can update the details of existing customers based on customerID or if the customer is not present, it will create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
